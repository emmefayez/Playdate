# Playdate

Playdate is an interactive catalogue that collects activities to do with
children from 1 to 10 y.o.

_Why Playdate_

Parenthood it's a strange journey. It's easy to stumble in the guilt-loop of
"not spending enough quality time" with your kids and at the same time beign too
tired to come up with ideas of what to do together.

This is way I created Playdate: a platform where caregivers or educators can
share their knowledge about activities, each entry contains a short description
of the activity and the age group to which is addressed.

The activities can be filtered by keyword, each activity should have a title,
the age to which is addressed and a short description.

_Future features_

The more, the merrier! In the future Playdate will contain a feature to organize
group activity, allowing a user to organise an activity or join one (and maybe
have a quick chat before to the organizer!).

There is no real authentication, _yet_. Once it will be possible for real to
log-in, each user will be able to add an activity to their favorites list, that
will be shown in their profile.

There is already space for a **places catalogue** using this API of **Open Data

There are also three guards to check if the provided id exsists.

**FrontEnd**

The following components are fully functional:

- Home
- Navbar
- Info (about section)
- Activities (activities section)
- Addform (form to add an activity)
- Searchform
- Places
- Registration (registration form)
- Admin (admin dashboard)

While these needs to be completed adding authentication:

- User (user dashboard)
- Log in

## Setup

**Database preparation**

Create .env file in project directory and add

`DB_NAME: playdate`

`DB_PASSWORD: YOURPASSWORD`

(replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual password)

Type `mysql -u root -p` to access the MySQL CLI using your password.

In the MySQL CLI, type create database playdate; to create a database in MySQL.

Run the following in the MySQL CLI: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED
WITH mysql_native_password BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD'; (replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your
actual password)

Run `npm run migrate` in the project folder of this repository, in a new
terminal window. This will create three tables: activities, users, favorities in
your database.

Run:

`USE playdate`

`SHOW TABLES`

`SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME`

to see how is built each one.

### **Development**

Run `npm start` in project directory to start the Express server on port 5000.
In another terminal, do `cd client` and run `npm start` to start the client in
development mode with hot reloading in port 3000.

**Libraries**

Playdate use Noty to display custom alert messages when some actions are
perfomed, you may find the complete documentation
[here](https://ned.im/noty/#/).
