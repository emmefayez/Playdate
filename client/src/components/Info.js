					<p>
						Parenthood it's a strange journey. It's easy to stumble in the
						guilt-loop of "not spending enough quality time" with your kids and
						at the same time being too tired to come up with ideas of what to do
						together.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Playdate you can browse to a catalogue of different activities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each activity has a title, a short description and a suggestion for
						minimum age.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h3>Share your knowledge!</h3>
					<p>
						Sharing is caring: on Playdate caregivers or educators can share
						their knowledge about activities they know.
					</p>
					<p>You need to register to add an activity to the catalogue.</p>
