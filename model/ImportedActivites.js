If you have any, give your kid/s an old pair of glasses, or make some fake ones with the materials you have at home. Go to a place where they are familiar, but before arriving explain the rules of the game: they have to imagine visiting this place for the first time as someone else. Invite them to write on a block-notes what they will do/ what they will notice. You can decide to land them your phone to take pictures from the point of view of this "stranger". Once at home, ask them to go through the picture and with the rest of the family, you have to guess who is this stranger.',

			"This activity is suitable for groups but can be done also by just you and your kid. You will need a worksheet, paper and pen and glue and to prepare some images representing a topic you want to address to your children. Print them ensuring there are 2 copies of each at least. Ask your kid/s to look at each picture and answer these questions about it on the worksheet: Who? What? Where? When? How? Do the same. Then glue the picture onto the worksheet. Make speech bubbles for the characters in the picture to say something, and write in what they are saying. Display everything on a wall or table, placing the side of the same picture by side for comparison. Ask the children to look at all the pictures and read their speech bubbles. Debrief the activity by asking questions such as these: How hard was it to answer the questions about the pictures? To write speech bubbles? How did your analysis of the same picture compare with the analysis of the other pair? What stereotypes did people find in the pictures? In the speech bubbles?",
